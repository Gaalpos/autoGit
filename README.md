# Power Shell scripts to automate git pull and git push

My first automation scrip. Let me know if something can be improved :)

## AutoPush
Auto commit and pushes all the new work to the master branch and all of your repositories. The commit comment is the current date & time.

## AutoPull
Auto git pulls all the remote work to your local repository on all of your repositories.\

### Todo
    1. Automate the way the scripts enters all the folders.

I need to lear how the scripts can be runned automatically when the pc turn on
